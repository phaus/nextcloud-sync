read README.md
read AGENTS.md
read implementation-plan.md and pick the most important thing to do while also resolving dependencies.

IMPORTANT:
- author property base tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after making the changes to the files, run tests
- update specs/implementation-plan.md accordingly
- when tests pass, add all files, commit and push

## initial Prompt

Hey, I want to create a CLI binary in Golang, that is able to sync folders to my nextcloud instance. 
It should allow a sync with `agent <source> <target>` whereas the `<source>` the source folder is and `<target>` the target folder. 

A folder can be a local relative, an absolute folder or a remote folder as an URL to a nextcloud instance (like `https://cloud.consolving.de/apps/files/files/2743527?dir=/uploads`)

We also need to persist an authentication? Maybe we can use generated app password for this?
Important! Do not implement anything just plan for now. 
Let's have a discussion and you can interview me. 

## save

Update specs/\*.md and create an implementation plan with bullet points and cite the specification or source code that needs to be adjusted.
